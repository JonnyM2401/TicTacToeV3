# TicTacToeV3

I'm learning to code and just built my first little project: a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

This is actually version three of my minigame. I've improved the layout and responsiveness for different screen sizes.

You can play it with a friend on the same device. Simple, but still proud. ðŸ’ª
